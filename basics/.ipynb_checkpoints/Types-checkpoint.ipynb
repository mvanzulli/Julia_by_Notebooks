And in Julia, this means you work on getting the types right.\n",

This gives a simple and unified way to deal with strings, but human diversity is extraodinary, and this diversity iw well expressed by the huge variety of alphabets, characters and writing systems that have been implemented for computer use. To deal with them *all* is a huge task, which the Base module in Julia does not attempt. For (most of) that, there is the JuliaString organisation.

    "All the types above are concrete types. That is, they have no subtypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is very useful to group types together. For example, both ``Int64`` and ``Float64`` are numbers, and one can do things with numbers without knowing exactly which type of number you are dealing with. For this purpose, Julia defines a supertype for every type (except the type ``Any``, which is its own supertype). For example, ``Float64`` has the supertype ``Real``.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can get complicated: ``Int64`` has the supertype ``Signed``, which has the supertype ``Integer``, which has the supertype ``Real``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the type ``Real`` includes both ``Int64`` and ``Float64``. Types like ``Real`` and ``Integer``, which can have subtypes, are called abstract types. The most abstract type of all is the type ``Any``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now. The actual type of a value in Julia must always be a concrete type. So where do abstract types come in? There are two answers:\n",
    "- some operations change the type of a value by promotion; abstract types help to guide this process\n",
    "- functions are written to operate on types. If you write your function to use an abstract type, it will work for all the types underneath that abstract type.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, you can write your Julia code without any type specifications at all. What happens is that Julia then uses abstract types to specify your code. Most of them time, this is absolutely fine, and the actual values that are used have perfectly appropriate types. But it can seriously hamper speed (as often happens in Python, for example), so if your aim is to write programs that run fast, you will need to learn how to use type specifications. As this course is for beginners, we do not cover that topic.\n"
